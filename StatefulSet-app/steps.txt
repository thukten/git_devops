Steps:
You will need to use two terminal windows. In the first terminal, use kubectl get to watch the creation of the StatefulSet's Pods.
#kubectl get pods -w -l app=nginx
In the second terminal, use kubectl apply to create the headless Service and StatefulSet defined in web.yaml.
#kubectl apply -f web.yaml
The command above creates two Pods, each running an NGINX webserver. Get the nginx Service...
#kubectl get service nginx
#kubectl get statefulset web
#kubectl get pods -w -l app=nginx
Get the StatefulSet's Pods:
#kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
