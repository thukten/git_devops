1. Create a Deployment based on the YAML file:
 # kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
2. Display information about the Deployment:
 # kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
4. List the pods created by the deployment:
  #kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
5. Display information about a Pod:
 #  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
 
6. Apply the new YAML file:
kubectl apply -f deployment-update.yaml

7. Watch the deployment create pods with new names and delete the old pods:
 # kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
Scaling the application by increasing the replica count
8. Apply the new YAML file:
# kubectl apply -f deployment-scale.yaml
Verify that the Deployment has four pods:
# kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
Delete the deployment by name:
#kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
